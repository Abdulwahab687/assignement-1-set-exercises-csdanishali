                <h3>Lucius Verus (Paul Mescal)</h3>
                <p>The grown-up son of Lucilla and nephew of Commodus from the original film. Raised away from Rome after the events of Gladiator, Lucius has built a life of peace that is shattered when Roman forces invade his adopted homeland. Thrust into the world of gladiatorial combat, he must channel the spirit of Maximus to survive and seek justice.</p>
                <p>Though he never knew Maximus personally, Lucius grew up hearing stories of the general who saved his life and stood against tyranny. These tales shaped his character and values, giving him a moral compass that guides him even in his darkest moments. His fighting style combines disciplined Roman military training with techniques learned from the various cultures he encountered during his exile.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>Marcus Acacius (Denzel Washington)</h3>
                <p>A former slave who has risen to become a powerful arms dealer and kingmaker in the Roman world. Cunning and charismatic, Marcus sees an opportunity in Lucius and becomes both mentor and manipulator to the young warrior. His true motivations remain shrouded in mystery.</p>
                <p>Marcus survived the brutal life of a gladiator decades earlier, learning that true power in Rome comes not from the sword but from controlling those who wield it. He has spent years building a network of informants, mercenaries, and politicians who owe him favors. While he presents himself as Lucius's ally, his ultimate goals may not align with the young man's quest for justice.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>General Acacius (Pedro Pascal)</h3>
                <p>A decorated Roman general with a complicated past, who serves as both ally and potential threat to Lucius. His military brilliance is matched only by his political ambition, making him a dangerous player in the power struggles of Rome.</p>
                <p>General Acacius rose through the ranks by leading successful campaigns against Rome's enemies in Germania and Parthia. Though loyal to Rome, he has grown disillusioned with the corruption of the co-emperors and believes a stronger, more unified leadership is needed. He respects strength and honor, seeing echoes of the legendary Maximus in Lucius that could make the young man either a valuable ally or a dangerous rival.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>Emperor Geta (Joseph Quinn)</h3>
                <p>One of two brothers who jointly rule Rome, constantly at odds with his sibling Caracalla. His more moderate approach to governance makes him popular with the Senate but vulnerable to plots from within the imperial palace.</p>
                <p>The younger of the imperial brothers, Geta advocates for maintaining the reforms implemented following Commodus's death. More scholarly than his brother, he believes in the importance of law and tradition, though his idealism sometimes blinds him to the harsh realities of Roman politics. His strained relationship with Caracalla creates a constant tension that threatens to erupt into civil war.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>Emperor Caracalla (Fred Hechinger)</h3>
                <p>The more ambitious and ruthless of the co-ruling brothers, Caracalla seeks to expand his power at any cost. He dismisses the Senate as weak and irrelevant, preferring to build his base of support among the military and the masses through spectacle and conquest.</p>
                <p>Caracalla believes in Rome's divine right to rule the world and sees himself as the embodiment of Roman strength. He patronizes the gladiatorial games to maintain public support and views any who oppose his vision for Rome as enemies of the state. His paranoia about potential rivals makes him dangerous and unpredictable.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>Lucilla (Connie Nielsen)</h3>
                <p>Returning from the original film, Lucilla has survived decades of political intrigue in Rome. Now older and wiser, she must reconcile with the son she sent away for his own protection while navigating the dangerous waters of imperial politics.</p>
                <p>The years following Commodus's death were not kind to Lucilla, who spent much of her life walking a dangerous line between various factions in Rome. The decision to send Lucius away haunted her, though she never regretted prioritizing his safety. When circumstances bring her son back to Rome, she must choose between political pragmatism and maternal love in a world where showing either weakness or emotion can be fatal.</p>

            <div class="character">
                <h3>Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi)</h3>
                <p>An aging senator who once worked with Maximus and Lucilla against Commodus. One of the few remaining voices for republican values in an increasingly autocratic Rome.</p>
                <p>Gracchus has watched with growing despair as the reforms he helped implement after Commodus's death have been gradually eroded. Too old to fight with a sword, he uses his sharp wit and political acumen to navigate the dangerous waters of the Senate. When Lucius returns to Rome, Gracchus sees a chance to reignite the flame of reform that has been slowly dying.</p>
