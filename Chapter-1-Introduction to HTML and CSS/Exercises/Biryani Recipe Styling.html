    <h1>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    
    <!-- Quick description -->
    <p>
        These are seriously the BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever made! They're super soft in the 
        middle but have those amazing crispy edges. I got this recipe from my grandma and tweaked it 
        a bit over the years. Trust me, they disappear really fast whenever I make them for friends!
